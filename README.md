#  Module 4 Challenge
> Module 4 Challenge for ASU AI Bootcamp

I did this assignment on my own, but there's a high possibility I help others as they experience challenges with their own code

In this challenge, I created a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions. Developing the solutions for this project involved gave me a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis, preparing me for more complex data scenarios in future programs.  By running this application, users will be able to identify top customers, popular product categories, calculate profits, and more.

## Installing / Getting started

Open the whole_data_analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook using a Jupyter server. Explore the data.

```jupyter lab
whole_data_analysis.ipynb
```

Run each part of the code in the notebook to explore the data
